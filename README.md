# ASP.NET-Web-Administration-Tool-VS-2013
Due to nature that the Web Administration Tool not being included in the Visual Studio 2013. 
Many have found great difficulty in starting up the tool such as browsing and location the server (ISSEXRPESS) going into
command line and starting it up.

I have decided to write a simple C# application that handles the starting of the Web Administration Tool and all the steps involved to get it up and running.
